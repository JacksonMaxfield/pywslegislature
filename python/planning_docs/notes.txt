1. would it be good to have auto replace only targeted params
    my reasoning: not really... if the call failed, which shouldn't happen with a proper web interface,
    then it will return the default and example calls with the full error.

    short: it can be handled client side, if client really wants to break,
    it doesn't have any effect
