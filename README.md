####About the Project
I am starting up this project because I personally think the Washington Legislature website could use a bit of a UX makeover.
Additionally, from a data science perspective, I feel that there is a lot of valuable information present in the WSL databases that
could be utilized for interesting datasets and other projects. Making this information more easily attainable and putting it into the
hands of others I believe will help get people to actively engage with their state government.
